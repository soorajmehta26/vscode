package.json is important

"%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"

to change to visual studio powershell put it in command line
then run cmake.js compile


actuallu it is using developer tools from visual studio 2022 alternative is "npm install --global --production windows-build-tools" but for some reason it is not working for me


Look at helloworld on desktop
